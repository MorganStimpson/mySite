                    I've been brewing since 2020 because of my curiosity on how the brewing process works and wanting to have a fun hobby to work on with my buddies. Here's a quick Unified Modeling Language diagram of the process for all you nerds out there!

                    My top three styles I have made so far are: 
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Oatmeal Stout // brewed November 2020
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Saison // brewed August 2020
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Imperial Ipa // brewed June 2020
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    As i've brewed i've learned a ton about the process and have new found respect for the craft, which has led me to begin a project called <a href="https://github.com/MorganStimpson/BrewberryPi"><b>BrewberryPi.</b></a> If you want to learn more about the project, help develop or want to incorporate this tech into your own brewing process let's get in contact!

                    Backpacking

                    I've been backpacking since 2015 when I was a senior in highschool! The picture above is of Skyline Divide over at Mt. Baker! It was an absolute treat of a trip! If you ever get the chance I highly recommend you at least take a day trip up to the mountain.
                </li>
                <li>
                    My top three backpacking trips so far: 
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Skyline Divide over at Mt. Baker
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Thunder Creek in Mt. Baker National Park
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Gem Lake in the Snoqualmie National Forest
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    With it's steep price point, backpacking hasn't been the easiest to get into for a college student, but over the years I have been able to aquire better tools for the trade and will continue this for the rest of my life!

                    Being the son of a nerd, d&d has been something I've known about since a child. It's absolutely a blast to gather around a table with some of your closest friends and just tell a massive story where everyone is fully engaged and wanting to just have a blast.
                </li>
                <li>
                    One of my favorite aspects of D&D is the ability to create a world and system that revolves around my buddies I am playing with. The stories that occur during a session and the shenanigns that occur always great fun.
