                        My teams project was to develop a water telemetry device that recorded information about the water within the Salish Sea. To achieve this we developed and maintained three distinct projects.
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <b>Water Telemetry Device:</b> A device which recorded salinity, turbidity and temperature of the water.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <b>Android Application:</b> An application which allowed those to access the telemetry device, pull information and push it to the server.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <b>Web Server Application:</b> A docker server that is hosted on by WWU, that stores all information about the Telemetry Device.

                    <li>
                        By far this was my favorite project to have worked on. Due to the nature of it being a legacy project and always recruiting new members, it helped push myself as a engineer and allowed me to become more agile in my development stratergies. Here is a little diagram of the Telemetry project incase you are curious on the various funtions of the work.

                    <li>
                        Once our models were developed we then created a rough idea of how our game would be interacted with. Using the Model View Control idea we developed a text based version of our game to make porting from a text version to a general user interface much easier on our end.

                    <li>
                        Along with this project we learned XML to properly store our users data and allow for savign through out the game if the user did not want to stay and play the game in one sitting.

                </li>
                <li>
                    The idea behind this is to create a small Raspberry Pi program that records the data of what the wort is doing. Wort as it ferments produces CO2, becomes more acidic and pushes the oxygen within a fermentation tank out of the chamber. With that in mention that is what I intend to record with this project.
